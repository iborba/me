# Skills

### Javascript / Typescript

I began writing JavaScript in 2007, when it was primarily used for front-end development. Since then, I have continued to use it extensively, and even began developing in Node.js a decade later.

While JavaScript has its flaws, I still believe it to be a solid choice for most business solutions around the world. Over the years, I have utilized **JavaScript** in a variety of contexts, including **microservices, monoliths, APIs, MVC-based front-ends, as well as with Jest, Express, Axios, GraphQL, Prisma, Postgres, MySQL, Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, Vue, and AWS Lambda functions**.

**TypeScript** is a subset of JavaScript that I also appreciate, particularly because it makes JS similar to my second language: C#.

### C#

I started working with C# there in 2007, and it has always been reliable for the majority of challenges I have faced. C# helped me integrate with large amounts of data and provided a secure environment for calculating transactions. Additionally, the .NET Framework and its associated tools, such as Analysis Services, SQL Server, and Reporting Services, allowed me to meet companies' requirements and deliver the best possible solutions at the time.

### Python

I have recently started learning it and find it to be a good challenge! Although I am not yet proficient, I have worked on some features and fixes on my own, and I am trying to incorporate it into some of my personal projects.

### Vue.js

I enjoyed using Vue.js as it provided me with a valuable learning experience. I discovered its potential and learned about the benefits of using good front-end frameworks. During my time using Vue.js, I created some amazing components and gained knowledge on front-end testing. It also helped me to better understand front-end life cycles.

### React

As Python, I've started learning it recently and found it amazing. I'm not proficient yet, honestly Iâ€™m on the way to be better here as it is a must nowadays in the market.

### SQL

Whether it's T-SQL, PL-SQL, PG-SQL, or any other variation, where there's a database, there's SQL. I've been using it extensively for years and consider myself proficient. It's probably the area where I use Google search the least.
