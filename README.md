# Skills

### JavaScript / TypeScript
I began using JavaScript in 2007, initially for front-end development, and later transitioned to Node.js for back-end projects. Over the years, Iâ€™ve used JavaScript extensively for microservices, monoliths, APIs, and MVC-based front-ends, working with tools and frameworks like Jest, Express, Axios, GraphQL, Prisma, Redis, MongoDB, ElasticSearch, and AWS Lambda.

- TypeScript has been a natural addition to my toolkit, offering strong typing that feels familiar, akin to C#, my second language.

### Golang
Iâ€™m actively developing a personal project involving Blockchain and Smart Contracts using Solidity. For the back-end, Iâ€™ve chosen Golang, which I use to build microservices and Lambdas, appreciating its performance and simplicity.

### C#
Iâ€™ve worked with C# since 2007, leveraging its robustness for handling large datasets and secure transaction processing. The .NET Framework, alongside tools like SQL Server, Reporting Services, and Analysis Services, enabled me to meet complex business requirements and deliver reliable solutions.

### Python
Though Iâ€™m new to Python, Iâ€™m enjoying the challenge and steadily building proficiency by contributing to personal projects and small fixes. Itâ€™s becoming a useful addition to my toolkit.

### Vue.js
My experience with Vue.js taught me the power of modern front-end frameworks. I developed reusable components, gained a deep understanding of front-end lifecycles, and utilized Cypress for testing, creating seamless user experiences.

### React
Recently, Iâ€™ve started learning React, finding it exciting and versatile. While Iâ€™m not yet proficient, Iâ€™m actively improving, as itâ€™s a valuable skill in todayâ€™s market.

### SQL
From T-SQL to PL-SQL and PG-SQL, Iâ€™ve been using SQL extensively for years across a variety of databases. Itâ€™s one of my strongest skills, requiring minimal external references during problem-solving.
