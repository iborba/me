I've just worked with small and big applications in Node.js, some of them are microservices which had to receive a bunch of offline sells, once a day, and add them sorted in the database, doing validation when needed but without stopping the processing.

Also just worked in some websites where the goal is being always fast letting the write concernment as a second goal prior to read and speed.
