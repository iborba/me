My name is Israel Machado de Borba, and I have been working in software development since 2007. Over the years, I’ve built and evolved systems across multiple stacks, consistently delivering solutions aligned with real business outcomes. This journey shaped me into an adaptable, results-driven engineer with a strong problem-solving mindset.
I spent a significant part of my career working with .NET, contributing to complex systems that demanded precision and long-term maintainability. Transitioning to Node.js expanded my architectural perspective and enabled me to design and scale high-performance, distributed applications. I also have hands-on experience with Vue and React, allowing me to contribute effectively across the full stack when needed.
I have designed and operated microservices architectures, leveraging Docker and cloud-native practices to improve scalability, reliability, and operational efficiency. My experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases allows me to make informed trade-offs when modeling data and optimizing performance.
In addition to my technical background, I hold a degree in IT Management, which helps me bridge technical and business perspectives, communicate effectively with cross-functional teams, and deliver projects predictably.
I’m driven by continuous improvement. What I don’t know today, I learn tomorrow. I approach challenges with curiosity, discipline, and the belief that no problem is unsolvable.




Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Senior Product Engineer position at Nooks, as the role perfectly aligns with my expertise and passion for building impactful and scalable products. With over 15 years of experience in software engineering, including roles as a Engagement Manager, Tech Lead and Software Architect, I’ve developed and launched multiple high-performing systems across diverse industries, and I am confident that my skill set and approach will greatly benefit your team.

As in my past self-employed challenges and in some companies as GFT and Stoneridge, I led product development, system architecture design, and team mentorship, using technologies like Node.js, Docker, and GraphQL to deliver scalable solutions. I worked closely with stakeholders to prioritize product features, reduced operational costs, and improved system performance. My hands-on approach in improving user experience, optimizing processes, and ensuring code quality allowed me to drive significant results, such as reducing churn and streamlining integrations.

Additionally, my experience with microservices, cloud platforms (AWS, Azure), and front-end development using Vue.js, React and Angular (even not being my stronger area) ensures that I can effectively contribute to all aspects of product engineering. I’ve led teams to transition from monolithic systems to microservices architectures, boosting scalability and efficiency.

I am highly motivated by Nooks' vision of empowering professionals and creating efficient digital workflows. I am eager to contribute my technical and leadership skills to drive product innovation and performance at Nooks. I believe my background in building high-quality products, combined with my passion for mentoring teams and delivering results, makes me a strong fit for this role.

I know in the world there are more experienced or smarter guys than me, but I'm really engaged in making part of this team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the continued success of Nooks.

Sincerely,
Israel Borba
